Hello and Welcome! My name is **Daotan Wang**. I am a junior Mechanical Engineering student at Tsinghua University, expected to graduate in June 2027. Currently, I am a research intern at OME Lab supervised by Prof. Zhen Zhang, where I focus on applying control theory to optimize the precision and stability of mechatronic systems. Previously, I served as a research intern at RVSE Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Rui Chen](https://callmeray.github.io/homepage/), where I worked on visuo-tactile sensing and imitation learning to empower robots with dexterous manipulation capabilities.

In the future, I aspire to further my studies in robotic manipulation, aiming to enable robots to manipulate objects with greater precision and fluidity. Simultaneously, I also enjoy dismantling, assembling, and designing innovative robotic hardware.
